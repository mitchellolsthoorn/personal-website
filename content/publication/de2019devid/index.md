abstract: "Decentralized applications, also known as dApps, are the new paradigm for writing business-critical software. Recruiting developers with appropriate qualifications and skills for this activity is key, yet challenging. The main problem is that the portfolio of developers is usually scattered across centralized platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn, and vendor locked. This can result in an incomplete impression of their capabilities. We address this problem and introduce DevID, a blockchain-based portfolio for developers. Over time, this portfolio enables developers to build up a trustworthy collection of records that showcase their capabilities and expertise. They can import data assets from third parties into a unified DevID portfolio, add projects and skills, and receive endorsements. All portfolio records are stored on a scalable distributed ledger and owned by developers themselves. The essential idea is to exploit the tamper-proof property of the blockchain while providing durable storage. To demonstrate the practical value of DevID, we build the competition-based platform, dAppCoder, for the development of decentralized applications. On dAppCoder clients are able to submit their ideas and developers can find work. dAppCoder utilizes DevID portfolios to match these clients and developers. We fully implement our ideas and conduct a deployment trial. Our trial demonstrates that DevID is efficient at storing portfolio records."
